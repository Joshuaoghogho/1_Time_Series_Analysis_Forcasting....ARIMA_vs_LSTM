## âœ… PROJECT TITLE:
 Time Series Forecasting of Monthly Milk Production Using ARIMA & LSTM
## ðŸ”¹ PROJECT PURPOSE â€“ Time Series Forecasting of Milk Production
 This project aimed to develop predictive models using 168 months (14 years) of historical data.
 The objective was to understand seasonal trends, remove fluctuations, & build robust forecasting systems for better dairy supply chain decision-making. 
ARIMA Model: Trained on the first 12 years & tested on the last 2 years.
LSTM Model: Used the â€˜Productionâ€™ feature, with 85% of the data for training & 15% for testing. 
These models help enhance production planning, reduce waste, & support business strategies with data-driven forecasts.
## ðŸ”¹ PROBLEM STATEMENT â€“ Forecasting Milk Production
 Milk production is highly seasonal and impacted by biological cycles and weather. Without proper forecasting, the industry faces:
Overstocking or shortages due to poor demand estimation
Wastage of perishable products. Inefficiencies in budgeting and supply chain operations
## ðŸ”¹ TECHNOLOGIES USED â€“ Python, I built a Seasonal ARIMA model (SARIMA(2,0,0)(0,1,1)[12]) 
using stepwise AIC optimization and validated predictions using visual and statistical analysis.
## ðŸ“ˆ AIC: 1072.066
## ðŸ“‰ MAE:~173 
## RMSE: ~195. 
The model also forecasted production 24 months ahead for strategic planning.
In parallel, I developed an LSTM Deep Learning model using scaled time-window sequences to capture complex temporal dependencies. 
It provided significantly improved accuracy.
## ðŸ”¹ MODEL EVALUATION COMPARISON
Metric ARIMA LSTM 
MAE 172.96 23.56 
MSE 38068.86 1023.72 
RMSE 195.11 32.00 
## âœ”Interpretation: LSTM outperformed ARIMA across all metrics, capturing complex patterns & reducing forecast error significantly.
## ðŸ”¹ FINDINGS: The original time series was non-stationary with upward trend & seasonality. Applied ADF test to confirm stationarity after differencing.
ARIMA(2,1,2) was selected based on ACF/PACF & AIC.
Residuals showed no autocorrelation, validating model reliability.
## ðŸ”¹ SCENARIO PLANNING FOR GROWTH & SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGY
 I simulated company growth scenarios using model forecasts:
ðŸ“Š What if: Demand increases by 10%? Thereâ€™s a 10% supply chain delay?
## Example Forecast Output:
## Date        Forecast          +10% Demand           -10% Supply 
Jan 1976       859.93             945.92                773.94 
Feb 1976       867.15             953.87                780.44
Mar 1976       899.50             989.45                809.55  
â†’ Result: Helps assess capacity, resource needs, avoid under/overproduction, and improve responsiveness.
## ðŸ”¹ DECISION-MAKING STRATEGY
Enable data-driven production planning
Improve inventory control and reduce operational waste
Support long-term budgeting & logistics efficiency
## ðŸ”¹ AUTOMATION & DASHBOARDING
Setup automated forecasting pipelines
Create dashboards using Python, Power BI, or Tableau
Continuously retrain models for accuracy
## ðŸ”¹ TECHNIQUES APPLIED
âœ… Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test for stationarity
âœ… Auto-ARIMA with AIC optimization
âœ… Deep LSTM Network for long-sequence learning
âœ… Custom Matplotlib visualizations
âœ… Model validation using train-test split
âœ… Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE for performance
## ðŸ”¹ BUSINESS IMPACT
âœ” Dairy producers can align feeding schedules with predicted peaks
âœ” Supply chain managers reduce wastage and streamline distribution
âœ” Retailers can match supply with forecasted demand
âœ” Enabled Scenario Planning (e.g., +10% growth, delays) to inform strategic decisions
âœ” Adaptable to other domains like Retail, Energy, Healthcare, etc.
## ðŸ“Œ This project not only showcases statistical modeling and deep learning skills but also emphasizes real-world business impact and strategic foresight.
